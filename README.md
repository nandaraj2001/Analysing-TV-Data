# Analysing-TV-Data 

Here's my very first data science project. I have analyzed and extracted meaning full insights from a few datasets, combining methods of data manipulation and visualization.
                 The dataset that I looked at was of Super Bowl Data, generating insights into game outcomes, viewership and half-time shows.
